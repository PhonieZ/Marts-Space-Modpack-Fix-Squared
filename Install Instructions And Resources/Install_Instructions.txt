For a first time install, install this pack via the in-game mod manager.
Next, the steps that follow applies to old and new installs of this pack,
place the 2 mods in this folder in your Factorio mods folder, and upon loading
into the game, enable these versions of the Space Exploration and Space Exploration
Postprocess. After, restart your game to apply these changes, and load into whatever
saves you are going to play on, do not sync changes. Finally, after you have done this,
you should be able to re-enable the newer versions of the Space Exploration and Space
Exploration Postprocess mods, and house waterfilling should work as normal.
