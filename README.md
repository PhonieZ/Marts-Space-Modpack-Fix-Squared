# Marts-Space-Modpack-Seoh-Fix-Squared
This is a version of Martincitopants' Space Modpack, which fixes the dependency error that the Seoh fix, and original modpack both have, fixes house waterfilling not working, and also adds some extra QOL mods, these being YARM and FNEI. Furthermore, this still includes the Space Exploration Simplified fix, which is also present in the Seoh fix.

To Install this pack, for a first time install, install this via the mod manager. Next, this applies to old and new installs of this pack, install these mods in the google drive link below, and either delete the newer versions of the mods that you just put in (Space Exploration, and Space Exploration Post Process), or enable the older versions of those mods, to enable house waterfilling again. Anyways, here is the link:

And also, big credits to NikoMew for making the original modpack, without which the Seoh fix, and this fix, wouldn't have existed, without NikoMew's great effort:
