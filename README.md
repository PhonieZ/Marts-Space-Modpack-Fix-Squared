# Marts-Space-Modpack-Seoh-Fix-Squared
This is a version of Martincitopants' Space Modpack, which fixes the dependecy error which the Seoh fix, and original modpack both have.This also adds some extra QOL mods, these being YARM and FNEI, and finally still includes the Space Exploration Simplified fix, which is also present in the Seoh fix.

Again, credits to Slikk for making the Seoh fix:
