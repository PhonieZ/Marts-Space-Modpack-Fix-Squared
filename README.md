# Marts-Space-Modpack-Seoh-Fix-Squared
This is a version of Martincitopants' Space Modpack, which fixes the dependency error that the Seoh fix, and original modpack both have, fixes house waterfilling not working, and also adds some extra QOL mods, these being YARM and FNEI. Furthermore, this still includes the Space Exploration Simplified fix, which is also present in the Seoh fix.

Finally, big credits to Slikk for making the Seoh fix:

And also, big credits to NikoMew for making the original modpack, without which the Seoh fix, and this fix, wouldn't have existed, without NikoMew's great effort:
