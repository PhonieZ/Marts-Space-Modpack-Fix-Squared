# Marts-Space-Modpack-Fix-Squared
This is a version of Martincitopants' Space Modpack, which fixes the dependency error that the Seoh fix, and original modpack both have, fixes house waterfilling not working, and also adds some extra QOL mods, these being YARM and FNEI. ~~Furthermore, this still includes the Space Exploration Simplified fix, which is also present in the Seoh fix.~~
As of July 10th, 2022, Space Exploration Simplified (Fixed) and Endgame Combat have been removed due to Space Exploration 0.6.x incompatibility, and will not be replaced until these issues have been resolved.

~~To correctly install this pack, go to the link to the Github folder below and follow the install instructions:~~
This fix no longer works, however, I am working on a better alternative.


If you need to update to Space Exploration 0.6.x, go to the link below for a guide, and go to the link above if house waterfilling isn't working for you:

And also, big credits to NikoMew for making the original modpack, without which the Seoh fix, and this fix, wouldn't have existed without them:
